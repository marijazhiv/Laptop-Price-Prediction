- **Setup**
  
  1. **Clone the repository:**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your_username/laptop-price-prediction.git
     cd laptop-price-prediction
     ```

  2. **Install dependencies:**
     Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install required libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

     This will install the necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and their dependencies.

  3. **Dataset:**
     Place your dataset file (`laptop_price0.csv`) in the project directory.

  4. **Usage**

    Run the script `main.py` to train regression models, perform evaluations, and predict laptop prices for new input data.
    ```bash
    python main.py
