# Laptop Price Prediction

## Project Description

This project focuses on predicting laptop prices based on various features using machine learning models. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate laptop prices from information such as screen size, weight, company, processor, RAM, GPU, and operating system.

### Models Used in the Project

- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Extra Trees Regressor**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Linear Regression**

### Hyperparameter Tuning

To improve model performance, different hyperparameter tuning techniques were used, including **RandomizedSearchCV** for complex models like Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Extra Trees, and **GridSearchCV** for Ridge Regression.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
